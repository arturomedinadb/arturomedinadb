## 👋 Greetings! Welcome to my GitHub!
I'm glad you're here! My name is Arturo, and I'm a data analyst with an insatiable curiosity, always eager to learn from those around me. I’m currently based in Montreal, Canada 🇨🇦 (home of the best poutine 🥔🧀 and breathtaking fall foliage 🍁).
#### 🔍 A Bit About Me
My journey into data analytics began back in my undergraduate days, where data was almost mythical among consultants and business analysts. I was drawn to its complexity and endless potential to drive insights and actions. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in International Business 🎓, followed by a Master’s in Finance 💼, and I’m now pursuing a Master’s in Analytics 📊 at McGill University.
My passion lies in connecting business needs with actionable insights derived from data analytics. I strive to deliver comprehensive analyses and recommendations that bring measurable value to organizations.
#### 🌍 My Values
Social responsibility is integral to my work and life. I believe that everyone deserves equal opportunities, yet circumstances vary greatly. Those of us in a position to help bridge these gaps should make an effort to do so. I aim to continue collaborating with nonprofit organizations 🤝, leveraging analytics to support meaningful social causes.
#### 🌐 Languages & Interests
I’m fluent in English 🇬🇧, Spanish 🇲🇽, and German 🇩🇪 (obwohl es schon eine Weile her ist!). I’m also currently learning French 🇫🇷 as part of my ongoing language journey. Besides coding, you’ll often find me practicing martial arts 🥋 or enjoying various sports 🏅.

All the best,
Arturo
